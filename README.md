package.

## API access

To setup API access you need to generate `jwtIssuer` and `jwtSecret`

## Inputs

### ðŸ”¸ `zipFilePath` _Required_
Path to packed extension (relative to repository)
You can use [webext-buildtools-pack-extension-dir-action](https://github.com/cardinalby/webext-buildtools-pack-extension-dir-action)
to pack your extension directory and provide this input from it's output

### ðŸ”¸ `extensionId` _Required_
Your extension id at Firefox Addons

### ðŸ”¸ `jwtIssuer` _Required_
JWT issuer also called "apiKey" obtained from created credentials. Use secrets!

### ðŸ”¸ `jwtSecret` _Required_
JWT secret also called "apiSecret" obtained from created credentials. Use secrets!

## Outputs

### ðŸ”¹ `sameVersionAlreadyUploadedError`
`true` if the action failed because the version you try to upload already exists.

### ðŸ”¹ `validationError`
`true` if the action failed because validation at Add-ons side rejected your extension.

```yaml
uses: cardinalby/webext-buildtools-firefox-addons-action@v1
with:
  zipFilePath: 'build/extension.zip'
  extensionId: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
  jwtIssuer: ${{ secrets.FF_JWT_ISSUER }}
